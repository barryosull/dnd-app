# WIP

Can I add monsters now?

Make it easy to add them and the party members.

Cool, I have the players now.

Characters are done, which is great.

Now to do monsters.

This is looking gooooooddddddd

Cool, apart from music I am ready for tomorrow.

Ok, music is also done.

I have the bones of the theatre for the game done. Tomorrow is just about boning up on the rules and we're done. :D

It's looking good. I'm happy with this.

Will I try to improve this UI?

How hard is a grid?
- Easy
- Display it using background CSS
- Make it toggable

Can I make a DM version?
- Would need another tab
- How would they sync?
    - Using websockets seems complex . . .
    - Events propogated?
    - Would definitely make things easier
- This is too much work for now

Better maps:
- Have a single giant map, make it easy to drag it around and zoom?
- Have preprepared maps with a window of size on the image
    - CSS makes this very easy
    - Can have a single scale for grid, just make it scale to the same level and offset

I'm thinking a full refactor is needed, separate the model from the UI and implementation.
